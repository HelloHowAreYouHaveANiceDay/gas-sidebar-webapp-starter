# Google Apps Scripts starter template for bound scripts

Basic starter pattern for a bound script on google sheets. It's easily adaptable to any other Gsuite app as well as standalone scripts (no sidebar). This pattern uses [createTemplateFromFile](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/html/html-service#createTemplateFromFile(String)) to split out style sheets and script libraries so imports remain organized.

To use, clone this repo and push to your script project through [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/html/html-service#createTemplateFromFile(String))

Alternatively, copy and paste the relevant code into the apps script IDE and customize as needed.
